Potato Plant Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

Overview:-
  This project utilizes machine learning techniques to identify diseases in potato plants based on leaf images. It provides a web interface where users can upload an image of   a potato plant leaf, and the system classifies the leaf as healthy or affected by early blight or late blight.
  
Features
  Machine Learning Model: Developed a TensorFlow-based model trained on a dataset of potato plant images.
  Web Application: Built a Flask-based web application for easy interaction.
  User Interface: Simple HTML interface allowing users to upload images for disease classification.
  Accuracy: Achieved a 99% accuracy score on the test dataset, ensuring reliable disease detection.
  
Technologies Used
  Python: Programming language used for model development and web application.
  TensorFlow: Machine learning framework used for model training and prediction.
  Flask: Micro web framework used for developing the backend server.
  HTML/CSS: Basic frontend for user interaction.

Future Improvements
  Enhance model robustness with more diverse datasets.
  Improve user interface with advanced features and real-time feedback.
  Deploy the application for broader accessibility.
